## General information
OceanOPS Web Service API is a REST API designed to distribute metadata, in interoperable and ready-to-use formats, to integrate other software (usually under machine to machine schema). The metadata distributed by this API are available in two common data formats: .json, and .xml (WMDR compliant).
